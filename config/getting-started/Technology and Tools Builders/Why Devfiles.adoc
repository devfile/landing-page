== Technology and Tools Builders

'''''

=== *Shielded from runtime specific implementation*

No need to build custom runtime support. Let the expert do the job.
Runtime teams know the best way to build and run applications on their
servers.

=== *Zero maintenance for runtime support*

Tools will get the runtime support update for free whenever a new stack
gets updated in the devfile registry. New stacks can be picked up by the
tools easily without tools update.

=== *Shared configuration that can be reused across different tools*

Different tools work in a slightly different way. Sometimes it is hard
to convince users to switch to your tool due to configuration
differences. Sharing the same devfile specification support reduces the
hurdle for users to make that change.
