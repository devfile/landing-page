Contributions are welcome!

## Code of Conduct

Before contributing to this repository for the first time, please review our project's [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/devfile/api/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Issues

- Issues are tracked via the the [devfile/api](https://github.com/devfile/api) repo. Open or search for [issues](https://github.com/devfile/api/issues) with the label `area/landing-page`.

- If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/devfile/api/issues/new/choose). You can tag issues with `/area landing-page`.

### Pull Requests

All commits must be signed off with the footer:

```
Signed-off-by: First Lastname <email@email.com>
```

Once you set your user.name and user.email in your git config, you can sign your commit automatically with git commit -s. When you think the code is ready for review, create a pull request and link the issue associated with it.

Owners of the repository will watch out for and review new PRs.

If comments have been given in a review, they have to be addressed before merging.

After addressing review comments, donâ€™t forget to add a comment in the PR afterward, so everyone gets notified by Github and knows to re-review.
