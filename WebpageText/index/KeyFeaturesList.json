  "Devfile for Stacks": "The stack devfiles can be found under a devfile registry. They provide generic application build and run support for applications that use a specific language or framework. Each stack also provides starter projects that help you to stand up a brand new application quickly.",
  "Devfile for Projects": "Having the devfile included as part of your application’s source code makes your development environment easily reproducible. No matter where you load your application, it will get built and run in the same way as specified in the devfile file.",
  "Community Registry Support": "You have access to a community hosted registry where you can discover stacks and samples provided by runtime and tools teams who have configured them with best practices and common tools configurations.",
  "Custom in-house registry": "If you prefer, you can also provision and manage your own enterprise managed registry that allows you to customize what run times you want to make available to your teams.",
  "Developer Environment’s Configuration as Code": "Having the devfile included as part of your application, you can check in the devfile together with your source code. It makes your development environment easily reproducible. No matter where you load your application, it will get built and run in the same way as specified in the devfile file.",
  "Parent support": "Using the devfile parent support, your application inherits the behavior of an existing devfile stack. When there is an update on the registry stack, like security fixes and runtime updates, your application automatically picks them up.",
  "Stacks/samples/starter projects": "The devfile community registry is populated with stacks, samples, and starter projects that help teams accelerate their application development.",
  "Support for the full application lifecycle": "With devfiles, you have help throughout the entire application lifecycle. You start from the starter projects to start an application from scratch, use inner loop support for rapid application development, and the outer loop support to test out the application that is built in a way that closely resembles the production build and pipeline."
