    'Make development environments easily reproducible',
    `Development environments can be cumbersome to create, and as a result
        developers become locked into a single local configuration to avoid
        requirements becoming mixed up or interfering with each other. With
        devfiles, development environments become reproducible and disposable -
        they are now quick to create, can be thrown away at will, and can easily
        be re-created when needed.`,

  [
    'Improve development consistency across teams and projects',
    `Who has not heard the famous “but it works on my machine”! It can be
        challenging to chase down problems when your development environment is
        drastically different from your production environment. Devfiles provide
        a mechanism for teams to share configurations across projects, and
        provide a single source of truth throughout the application lifecycle.
        Check them in and manage them into your source repository.`,
  ],
  [
    'Reduce security risks and maintenance costs',
    `With so many layers and dependencies of today’s modern applications,
        security and maintenance can be both complicated and difficult. Since
        devfiles can be managed from a central location, you only need to update
        them once to get them properly aligned across the developer teams.
        Following security requirements and dependency versions gets simpler and
        more consistent with minimium disruption.`,
  ],
  [
    'Accelerate developer onboarding and leverage expertise of the community',
    `Modern applications use many different technologies, runtimes,
        frameworks and tools can make it challenging to understand all the
        available options to code, build, test, debug, deploy and update your
        applications. Devfiles allow you to inject expertise shared from other
        developers and communities into your team's development environment.
        Codifying configuration and best practice workflows helps lessen the
        requirement on every developer in your organization to understand how to
        manage and configure all these layers themselves.`,
